    "### Motivation\n",
    "Welcome to the Harvard-qBraid program, which is an experiential learning program. We have worked hard to identify problems at the bleeding edge of quantum computing yet are approachable with minimal background knowledge. We do not expect you to completely solve any of the problems we have identified for you, but rather give you a flavor of what it's like to struggle with the most challenging problems in quantum computing and make some progress in a positive direction. However, if you solve one of the problems meaningfully, that would be amazing, and you will push the field forward. Our hope is that through this program, you will\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learn enough quantum computing to start tacking one of the projects part of this program\n",
    "- Become proficient in quantum computing software (enough to build quantum circuits, simulate them, or run them on quantum computers)\n",
    "- Make enough progress on your project that future cohorts of this program can start from where you left off. Although, we hope that at least a few of you will carry on with the projects beyond this program, and we would love to see at least one of you at qBraid the upcoming summer.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you learn, execute, and deliver results on your project, our job will be to be there for you as a resource and a mentor. We will strive to provide an objective overview of the field of quantum computing and its many approachable open problems. As you learn more and develop a researcher's mindset, you will appreciate how asking the right questions is sometimes more important than the right answers. And our goal is to provide you access to qBraid scientists who can be sounding boards for you as you learn to navigate your way through cutting-edge research.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples of a successful project\n",
    "\n",
    "Following are some hypothetical examples of what a successful project might look like: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Assuming the project is to build education materials for quantum computing. A successful project would deliver a well-documented Github repository that contains all the content you would create for the project. The project would be considered a success if it has an innovative take on previously published explanations, e.g., it contains newly developed interactive widgets, animations, and new analogies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assuming the project is to use machine learning/artificial intelligence to optimize quantum circuit depths. A successful project would deliver a well-documented GitHub repository that contains a machine-learning model that takes input quantum circuits and outputs quantum circuits of lower depths. The project will have well-defined and documented inputs and outputs for the machine learning model. Further, it will contain extensive tests that verify the correctness of the machine learning model. A project that could become worthy of publication will also compare state-of-the-art methods to show how much better it is than previous approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a notebook on how to start. You can start at the beginning or start at the first challenge you don't know how to complete. "
